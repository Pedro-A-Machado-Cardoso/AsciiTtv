## Installation

Clone, create a virtual environment (python 3.11)

```sh
git clone
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install all requirements, edit [config.json](#config), run

```sh
pip install requirements.txt
python3.11 stream.py
```

## Config

Config options are streamer, resolution and tileset. 

- Streamer: Specifies which stream to put in the terminal. Use the same as its shown in the url (all lowercase).
- Resolution: specifies how many pixels will be skipped (so higher = smaller).
- Tileset: What symbols to use for ASCII display. For correct behavior, make it a single string with no spaces. To the left the "white" tiles, making a gradient into "black" tiles.
